206777,2019-06-27,Trash - Backdoor,"We have PAID backdoor pickup, and our trash has not been picked up for the last two weeks.  This seems to be an ongoing problem with Red River, and I was told a few weeks ago by one of the drivers who came to get our garbage after yet another request to HubNashville that the regular driver on our route does not like to go up our driveway.  This is absolutely unacceptable, especially since we are PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE for backdoor pickup and this has not been an ongoing issue until the last few moths.  Please address this immediately and arrange for our garbage to be picked up ASAP.  

Secondly, Metro needs to seriously reevaluate it?s operating contract with Red River.  There is very little customer service when you call them directly, if you can even get someone to answer the phone.

I went back on the video and saw that every can within site of my cameras were emptied except mine.  The driver drove by my two cans twice, within 10 to 12 feet of them,  without ever slowing down.  He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone's cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn't empty mine.  His answer was ""Oh, I guess I didn't see them"".  Isn't that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.  Yeah Tuesday, because of the holiday I guess all pick up people are off.  If the cans are not picked up by Tuesday I'll be calling my councilman and asking for an investigation.
