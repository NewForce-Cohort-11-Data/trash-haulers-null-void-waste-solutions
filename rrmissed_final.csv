My senior citizen mom has back yard service. This would be the 2nd time that this  mistake has happen for not getting her back yard trash. I don?t give too craps if your low/ on staff or new hires and their  forgetting to pick up her trash in the back. Or is it the fact that their lazy to do the job? It?s been  several occasions where I came to  visit and her can wasn?t push back in it?s  original backyard spot and I had to do it. What if my mother didn?t have  children? Who would take the  initiative to roll her bin back? The  garbage workers could care less. I shouldn?t have to call or place tickets regarding trash!!!! This is  Ludacris!!!! They forgot to pick up her trash last  Wednesday so they came  Tuesday.  Wednesday Is her  original pick up day. Just because they came on Tuesday is NOT!! An excuse to not come on her  original pick up day!!!! She still had more trash for pick-up. Now this whole trash  schedule is out of order. Why do you offer this service if you can?t own up to this job? This is the last time that this matter is going to happen!!! I will be paying a visit to the  supervisor and more!!!!!! I know it?s the two lady?s that Handels the claim ticket process and I think one of them is name Cindy?

188925,2019-05-23,Trash - Curbside/Alley Missed Pickup,"This is the second complaint that I am issuing regarding two separate incidents of my worker not picking up my trash.  The first incident was closed indicating that my bin was not on the curb (per the worker), which is ridiculous.  I work from home now, so I heard the truck go up the street - when I looked, the trash bin was lifted but the bin was not emptied.  I have pictures of the bin and how it was placed back on my land, as well as my neighbors - one who's bin is on the grass (like mine) and one who's bin was emptied from the driveway.  My bin has been almost demolished by this worker as well -  when it rains, my bin floods.  I understand normal wear and tear, but these episodes are making me question why this is occurring with no action by Public Works.  

I am soliciting your assistance in not only having consistent trash pick up (my bin is awaiting pickup due to two escalated ticket requests - 188904 and 188849.

Thank you!  I have pictures that I'd like to provide as well.

236809,2019-08-23,Trash Collection Complaint,"Resident says the entire street was missed and they are missed every week. He doesn't understand why their carts are not being serviced unless they call. He says that he called last week to report being missed, the truck came out and driver was only going to empty his cart but he pointed out to the driver that there were other carts sitting out as well that had been missed so the driver went ahead and emptied them as well. Resident and his neighbors want this issue resolved.","4418 Winston Ave W, Nashville, TN 37211, United States",37211,RED RIVER,2405,27.0,1753539.39941554,633562.400721845,4418 WINSTON AVE W,2019-08-23,True,7,2019-08-23,7,200,True

I called my next door neighbor and they stated their two containers were not emptied yesterday either.  I usually hear and see the trash truck go down our street and then come back up.  My neighbor indicated the same and neither of us saw or heard the truck yesterday.
The recycling truck DID come.thru and collect yesterday.
We have trash that carries odors and it is not good to have it sitting for another week.
If the truck will be coming around to collect, please have someone.call me so I'm able to get the container back down the driveway.

This the 2nd time the trash was not picked up in a matter of 30-45 days.  I need it emptied as soon as possible.  The last time I complained they said it would be 26 to 48 hours and it wasn't picked up until the following Thursday on the regular pick up day.  I hope this doesn't happen again.

206777,2019-06-27,Trash - Backdoor,"We have PAID backdoor pickup, and our trash has not been picked up for the last two weeks.  This seems to be an ongoing problem with Red River, and I was told a few weeks ago by one of the drivers who came to get our garbage after yet another request to HubNashville that the regular driver on our route does not like to go up our driveway.  This is absolutely unacceptable, especially since we are PAYING AN ADDITIONAL FEE for backdoor pickup and this has not been an ongoing issue until the last few moths.  Please address this immediately and arrange for our garbage to be picked up ASAP.  

Secondly, Metro needs to seriously reevaluate it?s operating contract with Red River.  There is very little customer service when you call them directly, if you can even get someone to answer the phone.  That is why I no longer call them but instead use HubNashville to register my complaint.","6670 Jocelyn Hollow Rd, Nashville, TN 37205, United States",37205,RED RIVER,1304,23.0,1697781.80062834,642459.201976859,6670 JOCELYN HOLLOW RD,2019-06-27,True,3,2019-06-27,3,200,True

He emptied my next door neighbors can, He emptied the can across the street from where my cans were and he went up and down the streets emptying everyone's cans but mine.  This is not the first time this has happened.  I even watched him drive by my cans once when I was outside watching.  I stopped him on the way out of the neighborhood and asked the driver way he didn't empty mine.  His answer was ""Oh, I guess I didn't see them"".  Isn't that his job?  To look for cans at the curb so he can empty them.  My cans were at the curb, the view of them was not obstructed by vehicles, bushes or anything else.  The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.  Yeah Tuesday, because of the holiday I guess all pick up people are off.  If the cans are not picked up by Tuesday I'll be calling my councilman and asking for an investigation.
