My senior citizen mom has back yard service. This would be the 2nd time that this  mistake has happen for not getting her back yard trash. I don?t give too craps if your low/ on staff or new hires and their  forgetting to pick up her trash in the back. Or is it the fact that their lazy to do the job? It?s been  several occasions where I came to  visit and her can wasn?t push back in it?s  original backyard spot and I had to do it. What if my mother didn?t have  children? Who would take the  initiative to roll her bin back? The  garbage workers could care less. I shouldn?t have to call or place tickets regarding trash!!!! This is  Ludacris!!!! They forgot to pick up her trash last  Wednesday so they came  Tuesday.  Wednesday Is her  original pick up day. Just because they came on Tuesday is NOT!! An excuse to not come on her  original pick up day!!!! She still had more trash for pick-up. Now this whole trash  schedule is out of order. Why do you offer this service if you can?t own up to this job? This is the last time that this matter is going to happen!!! I will be paying a visit to the  supervisor and more!!!!!! I know it?s the two lady?s that Handels the claim ticket process and I think one of them is name Cindy?

Why cant they put the cans back where they belong instead of just dumping them all over the alley after they have emptied them?
Cars cannot drive down the alley after the trash truck has been because the alley has cans all over the place.

188925,05/23/19,Trash - Curbside/Alley Missed Pickup,"This is the second complaint that I am issuing regarding two separate incidents of my worker not picking up my trash.  The first incident was closed indicating that my bin was not on the curb (per the worker), which is ridiculous.  I work from home now, so I heard the truck go up the street - when I looked, the trash bin was lifted but the bin was not emptied.  I have pictures of the bin and how it was placed back on my land, as well as my neighbors - one who's bin is on the grass (like mine) and one who's bin was emptied from the driveway.  My bin has been almost demolished by this worker as well -  when it rains, my bin floods.  I understand normal wear and tear, but these episodes are making me question why this is occurring with no action by Public Works.  

I am soliciting your assistance in not only having consistent trash pick up (my bin is awaiting pickup due to two escalated ticket requests - 188904 and 188849.

Thank you!  I have pictures that I'd like to provide as well.

I called my next door neighbor and they stated their two containers were not emptied yesterday either.  I usually hear and see the trash truck go down our street and then come back up.  My neighbor indicated the same and neither of us saw or heard the truck yesterday.
The recycling truck DID come.thru and collect yesterday.
We have trash that carries odors and it is not good to have it sitting for another week.
If the truck will be coming around to collect, please have someone.call me so I'm able to get the container back down the driveway.

The road was not obstructed by any parked vehicles to prevent him from getting to them.  My cans are full and I want them picked up by Tuesday morning.
